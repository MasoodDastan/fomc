    "# Topic Modeling\n",
    "Topic modeling is a statistical modeling approach that employs unsupervised Machine Learning to identify clusters or groups of similar words within text data. Through document analysis, this technique uncovers common themes and arranges them into meaningful clusters, encompassing various topics like contracts, invoices, complaints, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular project, I focus on utilizing Latent Dirichlet analysis (LDA) as a primary topic modeling method. LDA is employed to analyze extensive text data derived from FOMC meetings, categorizing the meetings into distinct concurrent themes. This process allows for a deeper understanding of the discussions held during each meeting, shedding light on the prevailing topics discussed in these financial gatherings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I adopt a similar approach as described in this [blog](https://highdemandskills.com/topic-trends-fomc/#h2-1) post to implement topic modeling using the [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ldamulticore.html#module-gensim.models.ldamulticore) package. The insights and methodologies presented in the mentioned blog significantly influence the analysis conducted in this notebook.\n",

# Analyzing the Impact of Federal Open Market Committee Meetings on Stock Market Performance

The aim of this project is to investigate the impact of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings on stock market performance and fluctuation. The FOMC's decisions have a substantial influence not only on the broader economy but also on the stock market. Therefore, the primary objective is to analyze how the content of the discussions during these meetings and the overall sentiment expressed among committee members contribute to the overall performance of the stock market.

By incorporating a variety of economic indicators into the final dataset, this study seeks to gain valuable insights into the interplay between FOMC meetings, financial market behavior, and economic indicators. The findings from this research can offer a deeper understanding of how the FOMC's actions and sentiments influence stock market movements and provide valuable implications for investors, policymakers, and financial analysts alike.

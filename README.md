# Analyzing the Impact of Federal Open Market Committee Meetings on Stock Market Performance

## Problem Statement:

The aim of this project is to investigate the impact of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings on stock market performance and fluctuation. The FOMC's decisions have a substantial influence not only on the broader economy but also on the stock market. Therefore, the primary objective is to analyze how the content of the discussions during these meetings and the overall sentiment expressed among committee members contribute to the overall performance of the stock market.

By incorporating a variety of economic indicators into the final dataset, this study seeks to gain valuable insights into the interplay between FOMC meetings, financial market behavior, and economic indicators. The findings from this research can offer a deeper understanding of how the FOMC's actions and sentiments influence stock market movements and provide valuable implications for investors, policymakers, and financial analysts alike.

## Executive Summary:

In this project



The primary objective of this research is to conduct an in-depth analysis of the effect of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings on stock market performance and fluctuations. Through a meticulous textual analysis approach, we aim to delve into the underlying factors that drive stock market movements in response to the outcomes of FOMC meetings. By examining the content of these meetings using topic modeling techniques, we seek to uncover the key themes, discussions, and focal points that have the potential to influence market sentiment and behavior.

Additionally, this study aims to gauge the overall sentiment among committee members during these meetings by employing zero-shot text classification on the meeting minutes. Understanding the prevailing sentiment among policymakers provides crucial insights into their collective expectations, attitudes, and decisions that shape monetary policy.

By integrating a diverse range of economic indicators into our analysis, we endeavor to construct a comprehensive dataset that considers various macroeconomic variables. This holistic approach enables us to contextualize the impact of FOMC decisions within the broader economic landscape and identify potential interconnections between monetary policy decisions and overall economic performance.

Through our research findings, we seek to shed light on the intricate relationship between FOMC meetings and stock market behavior. The insights gained from this study have the potential to enrich the understanding of investors, policymakers, and financial analysts, as we unveil the mechanisms through which FOMC actions and sentiments reverberate in the financial markets. Ultimately, our goal is to provide actionable knowledge that can assist stakeholders in making informed decisions, predicting market movements, and navigating the complexities of the dynamic financial landscape.
